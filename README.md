# Project Code From Kenny Egun

- In this project the user was trying to implement an onclick event that closes the navigation bar when the About, Contact, Follow, and Portfolio, the menu should close.

- He was having issue on fixing it, the code he wrote was in main.js and it was modified to index.js. Go to the code in index.html and comment line 34 and uncomment line 35.

- Adjusted the class in the queryselector by adding a `.list` and then you can make it work by either using the `menu` class and code on line 11-14 or use code on line 16 to 21.
